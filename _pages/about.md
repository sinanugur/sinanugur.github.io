I am a senior bioinformatician and research scientist with expertise in statistical methods, machine learning, modeling, and pipeline development. I have a proven track record of success in developing and applying bioinformatics to solve challenging problems in biology. My PhD thesis was selected as a case study for New Zealand eScience Infrastructure and published in eLife, receiving the Best Publication Award from my PhD institution. I have also developed various open-source bioinformatics software and workflows for biologists, downloaded by thousands. I am always eager to collaborate to solve challenging problems in biology, biostatistics, and bioinformatics.

The tools that I developed and published:

| Tool | Download  | Purpose |  
|----------|-----------|-----|  
|MirMachine|[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/mirmachine/badges/downloads.svg)](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/mirmachine)| microRNA homology search tool using machine learning|  
|Cellsnake |[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/cellsnake/badges/downloads.svg)](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/cellsnake)|single-cell analysis tool for everyone |  


**Research Interests**
* Modelling and early prediction models in the context of personalized medicine
* Molecular oncology and cancer
* RNA biology, especially non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs, tRNA-derived molecules
* RNA-RNA interactions
* Biostatistics and molecular epidemiology
* NGS (DNA and RNA sequencing), transcriptomics from bulk RNA sequencing to spatial transcriptomics
* Reproducible bioinformatics pipelines, mostly using Snakemake, shell scripts, Python and R programming

**Skills**
* R, I am quite capable in tidyverse syntax (ggplot, caret, mlr3, Rmarkdown, shiny apps, functional programming, parallelization)
* Machine learning and data analysis in R
* Python (especially in bioinformatics context)
* Snakemake (I develop pipelines and also teach Snakemake)
* Biostatistics (basic modeling, survival models, and some newer machine learning algorithms)
* Linux (shell scripting and high-performance computing systems)
* Data Science and Machine learning (for predictive models, especially in R and Python, h2o, caret, Keras)
