I am a researcher at Department of Pathology, University of Oslo, Norway.  
My research interests include spatial transcriptomics, RNA sequencing, early detection of cancer and RNA-RNA interactions. I did my PhD (Biotechnology/Bioinformatics) at University of Canterbury, New Zealand. I was working on non-coding RNA interactions in prokaryotes. My PhD thesis focused on ncRNA-mRNA interactions in prokaryotic genomes (bacteria and archaea).

RESEARCH INTERESTS
♦ Non-Coding RNAs ♦ RNA biology ♦ RNA-RNA interactions ♦ Reproducible bioinformatics pipelines ♦ Early prediction of cancer ♦ Molecular oncology ♦ RNAs in prokaryotes ♦ RNA sequencing (transcriptomics) ♦ DNA sequencing ♦ Modelling and machine learning (ML) methods ♦ Deep learning

SKILLS
♦ R (tidyverse syntax, ggplot, caret, Rmarkdown, shiny apps, functional programming, parallelization) ♦ Python (biopython, numpy, scipy, Snakemake, parallel python, pandas, flask) ♦ Linux (shell scripting, HPC systems) ♦ Data Science (Keras framework, h2o, machine learning)
