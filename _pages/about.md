I am a researcher at Department of Pathology, University of Oslo, Norway.  
My research interests include spatial transcriptomics, RNA sequencing, early detection of cancer and RNA-RNA interactions. I did my PhD (Biotechnology/Bioinformatics) at University of Canterbury, New Zealand. I was working on non-coding RNA interactions in prokaryotes. My PhD thesis focused on ncRNA-mRNA interactions in prokaryotic genomes (bacteria and archaea).
