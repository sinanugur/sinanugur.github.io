I am a researcher at Department of Pathology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway.  

My research interests include spatial transcriptomics, RNA sequencing, early detection of cancer and RNA-RNA interactions. I did my PhD (Biotechnology/Bioinformatics) at University of Canterbury, New Zealand. I was working on non-coding RNA interactions in prokaryotes. My PhD thesis focused on ncRNA-mRNA interactions in prokaryotic genomes (bacteria and archaea).  



Research Interests  
♦ Non-Coding RNAs ♦ RNA biology ♦ RNA-RNA interactions ♦ Spatial transcriptomics of gut ♦ Reproducible bioinformatics pipelines ♦ Early prediction of cancer ♦ Molecular oncology ♦ RNAs in prokaryotes ♦ RNA sequencing (transcriptomics) ♦ DNA sequencing ♦ Modelling and machine learning (ML) methods ♦ Deep learning

Skills  
♦ R (tidyverse syntax, ggplot, caret, Rmarkdown, shiny apps, functional programming, parallelization) ♦ Python (biopython, numpy, scipy, Snakemake, parallel python, pandas, flask) ♦ Linux (BASH,shell scripting, HPC systems) ♦ Data Science (Keras framework, h2o, machine learning)
